It allows users to grant LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local models from Ollama access to custom tools represented as Python functions. The core functionality revolves around executing these tools based on LLM requests during a conversation or task.\n\nThe tool works by allowing users to define tools (Python functions) and expose them to the LLM. These tools can be invoked either through command-line arguments using the `--tool` or `-T` option, or directly within Python code using the LLM Python API. The tool plugin system allows for easy installation of pre-built toolsets, such as those for interacting with external APIs or performing specific tasks like mathematical calculations using simpleeval. The `--tools-debug` or `--td` option provides detailed output about tool calls and responses for debugging purposes.\n\nLLM's unique aspect lies in its ability to bridge the gap between LLMs and external functionalities without requiring complex agent architectures. It provides a simple, direct way to extend the capabilities of LLMs with any functionality representable by a Python function. This makes it particularly useful for addressing LLM limitations, such as mathematical inaccuracies, by providing access to reliable external tools.","keyFeatures":"[\"Enables LLMs to run tools from the command line.\",\"Supports OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and local models from Ollama.\",\"Allows defining tools as Python functions.\",\"Provides a tool plugin system for installing new capabilities.\",\"Offers command-line options (`--tool`, `--functions`) for tool access.\",\"Includes a Python API for integrating tools into Python code.\",\"Supports both synchronous and asynchronous contexts.\",\"Offers debugging output with the `--tools-debug` option.\"]","limitations":"[\"Tool functionality is limited by the user's ability to represent it as a Python function.\",\"Requires knowledge of Python to define and use custom tools.\",\"The tool's effectiveness is dependent on the quality and reliability of the underlying LLM.\",\"Limited information is available regarding security considerations for running arbitrary Python functions as tools.\"]","useCases":"[\"Developers extending LLM capabilities with custom tools.\",\"Researchers experimenting with LLM tool usage and interaction.\",\"Data scientists needing LLMs to perform accurate calculations using tools like simpleeval.\",\"Engineers automating tasks by integrating LLMs with system utilities.\",\"Individuals improving LLM responses by providing access to up-to-date information via external APIs.\"]"}]
